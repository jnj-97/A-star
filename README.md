# A-star
Note:
Tkinter,PIL modules compatible with python3 should be installed on your IDE or system
A demonstration of A-star algorithm using python and a small part of Bengaluru map 
Me and my friend have designed this as an ambulance navigation system so that we can calculate and output and also maintain a constant speed and eliminate variables such as traffic and road closures.
This project asks a type of emergency and decides a random location for a vacant ambulance, it then calculates the route from that location to yours and the time required. Then it calculates the route from your location to the nearest and relevent hospital and the time required.
The locations and routes are implemented as graphs and stored as dictionaries and lists and the time between 2 nodes are stord as dictionaries and tuples
The speed were measured taking speed as 50km/hr.
